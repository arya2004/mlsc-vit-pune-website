# Microsoft Learn Student Club (MLSC) VIT Pune Website

Maintainer: Soham Panchal

Welcome to the Microsoft Learn Student Club at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT) in Pune website revamp project. This website is designed with a focus on efficient resource usage, utilizing CPU design for navigation and featuring 3D models to showcase our team members' images and credentials. 

# Features

- CPU Design Navigation: We have implemented a unique CPU design for website navigation to provide an engaging and interactive experience to our users. 

- Optimized Resource Usage: Our website is optimized for minimal computing resource usage, ensuring a seamless and lag-free experience on a wide range of devices.

- Team Members Showcase: To introduce our dedicated team members, we've incorporated 3D models. You can view our team's images and credentials in an innovative way.

# 3D Models
We are using Ready Player Me (https://readyplayer.me/) to create 3D models for our team members. These models add a visually appealing and interactive element to our website, allowing you to get to know our team in a unique manner.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
